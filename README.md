numbers-thought-experiment
==========================

This is an idea that I came up with that should simplify transform an arbitrary number expressed in words into a number expressed in digits. For example:

* Ten -> 10
* Thirty-four -> 34
* Five hundred twelve -> 512
* One thousand six hundred point five -> 1600.5
* Six million five hundred thousand three hundred seventy eight -> 6500378

# Notes

* Sometimes people will use "and" to denote subsections of a number (like the tens/ones) but it should only really be used to represent the decimal point
